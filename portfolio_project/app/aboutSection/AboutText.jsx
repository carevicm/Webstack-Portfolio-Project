    <p className="text-base lg:text-lg">
      Hello! Iam Milan Carevic, a Full-Stack Developer with a strong background
      in web development. My journey began in 2018, exploring < br></br> e-commerce
      platforms like WordPress and Shopify, evolving into a specialization in
      crafting mobile-responsive front-end UI applications with seamless backend
      integrations.
      <br /> <br />
      My expertise extends beyond HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, focusing on
      selecting the right technology for each project to deliver exceptional
      results. I believe a developers strength lies in adaptation and
      problem-solving, not just language fluency.
      <br /> <br />
      Throughout my career, I have transformed mockups into user-friendly
      products, emphasizing user needs, visual design, and engagement. I bring a
      unique blend of practical experience and theoretical understanding,
      supported by my academic background in Microsoft Azure Data and AI
      Foundations.
      <br /> <br />
      Lets work together to make something spectacular!
